## Instruction

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

```{r load-packages, include=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(htmltools)
```

```{r mymap}
mymap <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(lat = 32.7157, lng = -117.1611, popup = "Favorite City")

mymap

```
